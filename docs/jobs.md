### How to find potential employers

Example job search: Electrical engineering + code + music + product design

- What would these roles be called?
  - Creative Developer?
  - Electrical engineer?
  - Product designer?
  - Creative technologist?
  - No definitive answer here, so we need to research our own place in the job market
- Search for companies and their job pages:
  - Native instruments
  - Ableton Live
  - Roli

Example job search: UX & design in a specific city

- Advertising & marketing agencies or "creative studios"

## Strategies

### Build & maintain your portfolio

- Show the work that you're proud of and represents your current skills and professional direction
- Make personal projects for your portfolio if your professional work doesn't represent your interests
- Teach yourself new skills after-hours to attract the kind of work you want to do

### Get in touch with people at the companies you want to work for

- Before you do personal outreach, research the company and find their official careers page
  - Apply for any open positions via the official channels
- Find people who work for the company on LinkedIn orelsewhere. Be resourceful and respectful
  - Send them a personal message:
    - Who you are & what your interests are
    - Why you're excited & interested in this organization
    - Ask for advice on how to get a job there and if there are any upcoming or open positions

### Track your communications & searching in a spreadsheet or digital notes app

- Who you've found & their contact info
- Which roles you've officially applied for and when
- Who you've contacted and when - you should follow up after some time. Don't be annoying, but do be persistent
  - Let them know what you've learned about the organization and what you've personally worked on in the meantime

## More advice

### It's a long game

- Persistence is key - it can take a while to find your next job. Finding a job can be a full-time job!
- It's a numbers and waiting game, but if you're organized and persistent, something will land
- Getting in the door is the most important step. It's always easier to get a new job when you have an existing job
- You can land a job at a company that's not your dream job, but you can learn a lot and build your skills and portfolio which will lead to the next job
- You can also start to build a portfolio of work that you can show to potential employers

### Long-term success

- Make friends!
  - Build your network
  - Go to meetups
  - Reach out to past classmates & coworkers
    - These are the people most likely to become your future client/boss/teammate/employee
  - Reach out to people with similar interests on the internet (social media, Discords, Slacks, etc)
  - Show & share your work with like-minded people. Help others out with their work

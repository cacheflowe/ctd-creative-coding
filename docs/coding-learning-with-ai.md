## Introduction

AI has drastically changed how professionals write (and learn) code, just in the last couple of years. This document provides some advice about how you can use AI to improve your coding skills and learn new things.

## Where do AI and coding intersect?

AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. It is a field of computer science that focuses on creating machines that can think and learn like humans. AI is used in a wide range of applications, from self-driving cars to chatbots to recommendation systems. An **LLM** is a type of AI that is designed to learn from data and make predictions based on that data. For the purposes of learning and boosting our coding skills, this is the type of AI that we will be focusing on. Here are a few LLMs that you might use while coding, and while learning to code:

Cloud-based LLM services:

- **ChatGPT**: [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/) is a version of GPT-3 that is designed to have conversations with users. It can be used to ask questions about coding, get help with debugging, and even generate code snippets.

- **GitHub Copilot**: [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is an LLM that is designed to help you write code. It can generate code snippets based on a description of what you want to accomplish, suggest ways to improve your code, and even help you debug issues.

- **HuggingChat**: [HuggingChat](https://huggingface.co/chat/) is an LLM that can be used to ask questions about coding, get help with debugging, and generate code snippets.

Self-hosted LLMs:

- **Tabby**: [Tabby](https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby) is a *self-hosted* LLM code assistant.
- **Twinny**: [Twinny](https://github.com/twinnydotdev/twinny) is a *self-hosted* LLM code assistant.

## How can AI help you learn to code?

AI can help you learn to code in a number of ways. Here are a few examples:

- **Code completion**: AI can help you write code faster by providing suggestions for what you might want to type next. This can be especially helpful when you are working on a large project or when you are trying to remember the syntax for a particular language.
- **Code generation**: AI can help you generate code snippets based on a description of what you want to accomplish. This can be useful when you are trying to solve a particular problem and you are not sure how to get started.
- **Code analysis**: AI can help you identify bugs in your code and suggest ways to fix them. This can be especially helpful when you are working on a complex project and you are not sure where to start debugging.
- **Error message explanation**: AI can help you understand error messages and suggest ways to fix them. 
- **Code feedback & refactoring**: AI can give you meaningful feedback on your code and make suggestions for improvements. 
- **Code translation**: AI can help you translate your code into different languages or platforms. This can be especially helpful when you're porting code from one language to another (Java to Python, for example).
- **Code education**: AI can help you learn to code by providing tutorials, quizzes, and other educational resources. It can also explain blocks of code to you, which is helpful when learning to read other peoples' code. This can be especially helpful when you are just starting out or when you are trying to learn a new language or framework.
- **Code inspiration**: AI can help you come up with new ideas for projects or ways to improve your existing code. This can be especially helpful when you are feeling stuck or when you are trying to think outside the box.

## Use cases

Here are a few examples of how you can use AI to improve your coding skills and learn new things:

- Paste your code into an LLM and ask for suggestions on how to improve it
- Ask an LLM to explain a particular concept or syntax that you are struggling with
- Ask an LLM to generate code snippets based on a description of what you want to accomplish
- Ask an LLM to help you debug a particular issue in your code
- Ask an LLM to explain an error message that showed up in your code or console

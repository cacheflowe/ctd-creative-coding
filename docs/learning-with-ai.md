# Coding and learning with AI

## Introduction

AI is drastically changing how novices and professionals write (and learn) code. This document provides some advice about how you can use AI to improve your coding skills and learn new things.

But first, consider this:

> AI can rob you of decisions and struggle - and the joy of being surprised. It robs you of learning.

> “Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something.”

## Where do AI and coding intersect?

AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, but is a very fuzzy term at this point in time. AI is used in a wide range of applications, from self-driving cars to recommendation systems to any number of productivity and multimedia tools. An **LLM** is a type of "AI" that is designed to learn from data and make [predictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrot) based on that data. For the purposes of learning and boosting our coding skills, this is the type of AI that assists our learning and coding practice. Here are a few LLMs that you might use while coding, and while learning to code:

Cloud-based LLM services:

- **Cursor/Windsurf/Replit/Claude Code/Gemini CLI**: The latest trend of AI coding assistants is IDE or CLIs that have AI coding tools built deeply into the interfaces. 
- **GitHub Copilot**: [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is an AI coding assistant that's built into VS Code.
  - Video: [Should Self Learners Learn How To Code With GitHub Copilot?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ouguDntLY) 
- **ChatGPT**: [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/) is a great resource to ask questions about coding, get help with debugging, and generate code snippets.

Self-hosted (offline) LLMs:

## How can AI help you learn to code?

AI can help you learn to code in a number of ways. Here are a few examples:

- **Code completion & generation**: AI can help you write code faster by providing suggestions for what you might want to type next. This can be helpful when you are working on a large project or when you are trying to remember the syntax for a particular language. AI can also generate code snippets (or entire programs) based on a description of what you want to accomplish. The spectrum goes from simple inline assistance, to inline AI chat, all the way up to "vibe-coding" where you describe what you want to do and the AI attempts to generate *all* of the code for you.
- **Planning**: AI can help you plan your project and create a roadmap document. This planning document can then be used by the AI to help decide what to work on next. This has now been more formally [integrated](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions) into some AI [tools](https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/rules).
- **Code analysis**: AI can help you identify bugs or potential areas of improvement in your code, and suggest ways to fix them. 
- **Error message explanation**: AI can help you understand error messages and suggest ways to debug the code. 
- **Feedback & refactoring**: AI can give you meaningful feedback on your code and make suggestions for improvements. Ask an AI to refactor your code to make it more efficient, readable, or maintainable, and this can become a great learning experience - you essentially have 24/7 access to a virtual senior developer that can provide mentoring and feedback.
- **Language translation**: AI can help you translate your code into different languages or platforms. This can be especially helpful if you try to port code from one language to another (Java to Python, for example).
- **Education**: AI can help you learn to code by providing tutorials, quizzes, and other educational resources. It can also explain blocks of code to you, which is helpful when reading other peoples' code. 

## My personal opinion

I use multiple AI code assistants every day to speed up my coding and learning process. AI has helped me learn new languages and platforms, and has raised the ceiling of what I'm able to accomplish. Tasks that I would've given up on a couple of years ago are now possible because of the extra boost that AI tools give me. However, I think that it is important to use AI as a *supplement* to your learning and coding and not as a replacement for it. AI can help you learn to code faster and more efficiently, but it's still important to practice writing code on your own and to learn the fundamentals of software and even hardware architecture. Consider the AI as a colleague and tutor, not as a replacement for your own growth and experience.

There are reasonable and emerging concerns about over-reliance on AI tools, in that they can erode our own critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities. However, we're at a point in time where AI tools are becoming more and more integrated into the coding process, and it's important to learn how to use them effectively, and critically.

## A likely(?) future of code abstraction

[Programming abstraction layers diagram](../images/programming-abstraction-layers.webp)

Just as JavaScript and Python are higher level languages that remove (or abstract away) the complexity of lower level languages like C or Assembly, AI tools are becoming the next higher level abstraction for coding that allow non-programmers to build applications without needing to learn as many of the intricacies of programming. The big question is where you want to sit in the spectrum. If you want to become a self-sufficient software developer, you need to learn the inner workings of programming langauages and the reasons that computers do what they do. This requires real practice. If you're a designer or product owner who occasionally wants to dip into building software to prototype something or build a pesonal tool, AI can help you do that, and this is a now-diverging path of coding education.

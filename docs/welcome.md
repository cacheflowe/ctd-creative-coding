### Hello ATLAS friends!

[Justin Gitlin](https://cacheflowe.com) here (he/him) - your lecturer for the Creative Coding course (ATLS 5660). I wanted to welcome you to our class and make sure you have the info to join our virtual spaces. This course will be remote and held via Zoom. I'm really excited to code with you all this Fall, starting Monday, August 28 at 4pm.
The [living syllabus](https://github.com/cacheflowe/ctd-creative-coding) will be updated throughout the semester, but is fairly stable. I have a solid outline of topics that I want to cover, but I'll be flexible and responsive to the natural progression of the class and individual needs. **Please read the course description in the syllabus, because this is not a frontend web development class** as some old descriptions suggest! We will be making *art with code*, not traditional websites. However, the coding skills we learn in the course will be valuable for any other coding adventures you go on.

## Preparing for class

One thing you'll need is an account for the [p5js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/). You should create one if you don't have one. Click **Sign Up** in the upper-right corner.

I'm assuming most of you will have some amount of code experience. If you don't (or don't have much) it would be advantageous for you to work through as much of the following intro code lessons as you can. There's a bit of overlap between them, but overlap is great at this stage in the journey. This will be especially helpful if you're a beginner, and I'll expect that you'll complete these lessons over the first few weeks of class if you don't already have this level of coding knowledge. If you're already beyond this stage in your code journey, then that's great - we'll all be working at our own level.

## üõ†Ô∏è Machine Learning

### How to do ML things

1. (Beginner*) Find or download a tool/library/service that someone else has created, and use it
2. (Advanced) Download a tool that someone else has made, and train your own data set, then use that
3. (Expert) Write your own ML tool using existing ML frameworks like PyTorch or Tensorflow

__*__ Just using a ML tool that is "ready to use" can be an [expert-level](../images/carmack-pytorch.png) journey

### Find an ML tool

ML is really good at dealing with images, so many of the popular machine-learning tools are either image generators or analyzers. However, some other popular ML tools deal with text, audio, and other data types to do amazing, magical things. Some places to start, depending on your interests:

* Computer vision (image analysis)
  * [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/)
  * [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)
* Image creation
  * Diffusers like [Dall-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/), [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/), and [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)
  * [GAN](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3)s
* Image manipulation
  * [Super-resolution](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/torch-srgan) tools
  * [Frame interpolation](https://github.com/megvii-research/ECCV2022-RIFE) tools
  * [Style transfer](https://genekogan.com/works/style-transfer/), [pix2pix](https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/) and other image-based generators & effects
  * [Palette extraction](https://github.com/angristan/palette)
* Text (or code) generation
  * [LLaMA](https://cocktailpeanut.github.io/dalai/)
  * [GPT-3](https://huggingface.co/openai-gpt)
  * [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
* Audio manipulation

  - [Spleeter](https://waxy.org/2019/11/fast-and-free-music-separation-with-deezers-machine-learning-library/)
  - [Open-Unmix](https://sigsep.github.io/open-unmix/js.html)
  
### Install an ML tool

How to install an ML tool:

* Some ML tools are fully hosted online and you don't need to install anything
  * [Stable Diffusion @ Stability.AI](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion)
* Some will be pre-packaged into a nice UI in a desktop app. This is rare
  * [Runway](https://runwayml.com/)
  * [Stable Diffusion GUI](https://nmkd.itch.io/t2i-gui)
  * [Waifu2x-Extension-GUI](https://github.com/AaronFeng753/Waifu2x-Extension-GUI)
* Some have online notebooks that are ready to use, usually in [Google Colab](https://github.com/dvschultz/stylegan2-ada-pytorch). This creates a virtual environment with a good GPU to use. You should be able to copy a notebook into your own acount and start using it. This will also usually cost money if you want a very good GPU.
* Some must be installed on your own computer. Sometimes a very fancy GPU is required (look for GPU RAM requirements). Often Linux and Windows are the target platforms
  * [This can be hard](../images/get-old-repo-to-run.png), [really](../images/get-old-repo-to-run-again.png)

# Creative Code
## Class 1 

---

## üìã Introductions

* Your [instructor](https://cacheflowe.com)
  * Interests: music, graphics, interaction, games
  * Show some projects
* Review the [course description](https://github.com/cacheflowe/ctd-creative-coding). This isn't a frontend course!
  * > This course explores creative uses of software development while introducing foundational programming concepts, techniques, and best practices. Using Processing and p5.js, students will learn a wide variety of tools that enable the creation of art, animation, interactivity, music, data visualization, and even utilitarian applications. While focusing on graphics, multimedia, and interactivity, the class will also touch on the importance of building the "digital plumbing" that supports our creative work.

## üìã What is code?

### Code is software, code is everywhere

* Code is usually written in text files, but there are also node editors and other ways to "code"
* Code is a web of logic
* [Code isn't hard, but it is frustrating](https://clivethompson.medium.com/programming-isnt-hard-but-it-s-frustrating-6cb740085243)
* Language & syntax
* Most modern languages are [very similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages)

## üìã What is code?

### Why do code?

* Jobs
* Interdisciplinary & creative work
* It's fun and magic!

---

## üìã What is code?

### How to love it

* Find something that speaks to your interests
* You'll each find your own path with code (languages, career paths)
* Find the magic
* Personal story of failure & persistence

## üìã What is code?

### How to learn it

* [Which language should I learn?](https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1560431550981804032)
* Practice! Try, fail, repeat
* It's better to start writing bad code than to let yourself get stuck 
  * [meme](../images/can-i-code-fast.jpg)
* *Write a lot of code*

## üìã What is code?

### Where to find answers?

* Break problems down & iterate
  * Ask the questions in English
* Places to search for code answers
  * Google
  * [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
  * Blogs/Tutorials
  * Slacks/Discords
  * [Technical documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/) - ([meme](../images/rtfm-he-man.png))
  * Community learning - ask each other questions
    * Since we don't have much class time together, this will be an important part of the class. Ask questions along the way. Use Slack.
* Don't get overwhelmed - some concepts take a long time, and this is a long journey
* We're learning a new language, but we don't have to memorize everything like a spoken language. We can always look things up on the fly. It's more important to learn the capabilities of the tools than to memorize syntax.

## üìã What is code?

### How to do code

* Get an IDE that's good for your language of choice
  * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular choice for web and general development
  * Processing comes with it's own IDE, and p5js has the online editor
  * Other languages often have specific IDEs and tools that work with that language
* Type your code into text files
* Compile or run your program

---

## üìã What is "creative" code?

* It's still just code! But with an emphasis on media, graphics, audio, and interactivity
* "Creative coding", is a buzzword that most commonly refers to:
  * [Generative art](https://github.com/cacheflowe/creative-coding-notes)
    * [Frieder Nake interview w/CU's Mark Amerika](https://www.rightclicksave.com/article/an-interview-with-frieder-nake)
  * Interactive installations
  * New Media Art
  * Making games, toys, apps, instruments, or anything **creative**, that's not just a typical website or app
* All code is creative!
* What kind of creative coder do you want to be?
  * Some [artists](../docs/artists.md) for inspiration
  * Let's use this class to learn, build a portfolio, and make conceptual work. Generative art becomes much more meaningful with an artist statement, a unique perspective, or a story to tell.

## üõ†Ô∏è Get your tools ready

### p5js (or Processing)

* For p5js, create an account for [the editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)
* For Processing, [install the IDE](https://processing.org/download/)
* If you'd like to use other tools like Unity, TouchDesigner, THREE.js, Openframeworks:
  * I can help during office hours, but you're largely on your own
  * I expect video documentation of your projects, since you can't turn them in via a link to the p5js editor. Use Canvas to hand in your video documentation if you go this route
  * Use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to post your code and upload a video to Canvas

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Get your tools ready

* Slack
  * Use this to help each other out - like we do in the "real world"
* Screen capture
  * OS X: [Quicktime](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721)
  * Windows 10: [Xbox Game Bar](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027180/windows-10-record-a-game-clip-with-xbox-game-bar)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Code basics

### Basic creative coding concepts:

* Variables
* Functions
* Conditionals (if/else)
* [for() loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop#Timeline_of_the_for-loop_syntax_in_various_programming_languages) - ([1972](../images/for-loop-50-yo.png))
* Arrays
* Animation
* Input
* Objects
* Classes

Every language has these - the first goal is to understand these constructs & tools

If you're *not* comfortable with these, come to office hours and study the following links:

## üìù Homework:

### If this is easy for you, try some stretch goals:

* Add animation or interactivity
* Get creative with color
* Build an "A" with different drawing functions. For example: ellipse() circle() and a rounded rect() can all draw the same shape
* Make your own "A" designs
* Build several different "A" logos
  * Explore p5 API and learn how to create even more shapes
* Build the "A" in a larger, designed layout with code
* Morph one "A" to another
* Make it "pixel-perfect": Load an image and draw your shapes on top to make sure it's perfect
* Make an interesting background - use an image or generate a pattern
* Use a different tool (Shadertoy, TouchDesigner, Unity) to make an "A"

---

## üìù Homework:

### Turn in your work via Canvas

* Post the link to your code on (https://editor.p5js.org/)
* Add a description of your intent, your successes, and failures
* If you're using a different tool, upload a video to Canvas or post a link to a video on YouTube (or elsewhere) and post your code to Canvas or GitHub

## üõ†Ô∏è Software Design (How to write better code)

### General advice for cleaner, better code
- Practice
- Ask for feedback from your peers or mentors (or AI)
- Refactor & clean-up your own code once it's working
- Study common coding techniques. What are people in the industry talking & writing about?
  - Watch talks from conferences
  - Read blog posts
  - Follow developers on social media

### Strategies

Use [Design patterns](https://medium.com/educative/the-7-most-important-software-design-patterns-d60e546afb0e)
- It takes experience to know which might be best in a given situation, so start trying them out!

Look for opportunities to [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) (Don't Repeat Yourself) up your code
- [Video: What is DRY code?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwTcjWtDAfc)
- [Article: "Is Your Code DRY or WET?"](https://dzone.com/articles/is-your-code-dry-or-wet)

SOLID principles
- [SOLID principles](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/11/01/why-solid-principles-are-still-the-foundation-for-modern-software-architecture/)
- [The SOLID Principles in Pictures](https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/the-s-o-l-i-d-principles-in-pictures-b34ce2f1e898)
- [Applying SOLID principles in React](https://konstantinlebedev.com/solid-in-react/)

Defensive programming

Try [Refactoring](https://refactoring.guru/) your code for better organization and code clarity
- Readability
- Comments
- Indentation
- OOP (classes) - [Example sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/cacheflowe/sketches/488Fdh1O1)
- Separate files
- Build scripts
- Package managers
- es6 imports

## üõ†Ô∏è How to build anything

- [Follow the engineering design process](../images/engineering-design-process.jfif)
- Break the problem down
  - Google the components of the problem, and follow the process above
  - Project management tools (Asana, Jira, Notion)
- Write ugly code, then clean it up once it works
  - Don't over-engineer it until it's working
- Ask someone for help/advice!
- What happens when you hit a wall?
  - Sleep on it
  - Go for a walk
  - Use [a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) [duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)
  - Try a different approach or reduce your ambition this time around. You'll figure it out with persistence!
- Build your toolkit as you find solutions
  - [Haxademic](https://github.com/cacheflowe/haxademic/) is one of mine

**Build a "generator"**

- Shapes
- Some ideas
  - [Basic example](https://editor.p5js.org/cacheflowe/sketches/JytAPkkLQ0)
  - Generate an environment
  - Or a character
  - Or a pattern
  - Or a particle system
  - Animate your generated visuals
  - Add sound!

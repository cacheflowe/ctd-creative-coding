# Class 13

## 📋 Faculty Course Questionnaire (FCQ)

* 15 minutes at the beginning of class for students to complete their online FCQs
* The purpose of the FCQ, how it's used in your course and department, and highlight its importance to you.
* Visit [https://colorado.campuslabs.com/eval-home/](https://colorado.campuslabs.com/eval-home/) using a phone, tablet or computer. They will need to authenticate using their campus user ID.

## 📝 Homework:

* Work on your final project!
* We'll present our work in class next week
* Final due date is Dec 16th, so I have time to write feedback

## üõ†Ô∏è How does a program execute?

* [Compiling vs Interpreting](https://yesfordev.com/is-javascript-compiled-or-interpreted/)
* Basic [control flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow) tools:
  * Functions
  * Conditionals
  * Loops
* Order of operations
  * UI thread can slow down because code executes serially
  * Multithreading breaks out of the predictable order of execution

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Shaping our sketches

* Remapping numbers
  * User input
  * [Sliders](https://editor.p5js.org/cacheflowe/sketches/t7su_ViJ3)
  * [Random numbers](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/p5js/random)
  * Data
  * [noise()](https://twitter.com/pantrymoth/status/1557085719318990850)
  * sin()
  * lerp()
  * map()
  * modulo `%`
* Normalizing numbers
* Using `map()` - Live demo
  * Map mouse input - normalize and use for rotation
  * Map time (seconds to screen width)

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time

* A few ways of checking time
  * Keep track of `second()`
  * Track `millis()` for other time intervals
  * `frameCount % 60`
  * `nf()`

## üìù Homework:

Build a clock

* Textual, graphical, or both
* Make it abstract or conceptual, not a [literal clock](https://p5js.org/examples/input-clock.html)

Some ideas

* Use [millis()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/millis) for fine-grained time display
* Build a countdown clock?
  * How many years do you have left to live? Use variables to calculate
  * [Doomsday Clock](https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/)
  * How long before Covid is over, with variables added to the equation
* Show multiple time zones, or use an invented time scale
* Does IRL time of day influence the color or drawing style?
* Add sound
* Apply time to your favorite activity
* Reveal the rhythm of time with shapes
* Use Javascript for more [Date functions](https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-dates/)
* Turn the time into another "poster" and change the content depending on the time of day

## üìù Homework:

Build a clock

* Inspiration
  * [Raven Kwok: Time](http://ravenkwok.com/time/)
  * [Humans since 1982: A Million Times](https://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks/60491636)
  * [Reza Ali: Reactions](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBogs4FH4E0/)
* Steps
  * Sketch it out on paper
  * Write some code, see if it sticks
    * Sometimes the code will lead us down different, interesting paths
  * Pivot when something isn't working and try a different approach

## üìã Review code

* Present your posters
* What's it like working with designers?
  * Do you have a good sense of design? 
  * Or can you find a designer to work with?

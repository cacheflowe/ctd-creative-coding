# Class 2 | August 30

## üìã Review code

* Present your ATLAS "A" programs
* What concepts are you not feeling great about?

## üõ†Ô∏è Drawing tools

* The graphics `context`
  * Adjust properties on the context before drawing a shape
    * `fill()`
    * `stroke()`
    * `translate()`
      * `push()`
      * `pop()`
    * `scale()`
    * `rotate()`
      * `CORNER` vs. `CENTER`
  * We've already seen many different ways of drawing a shape (`ellipse()`, `rect()`), but let's consider:
    * `image()`
      * Make sure you load the image with `loadImage()` before drawing
    * `text()`
      * Make sure you load the font first
        * Example in Processing & [p5](https://editor.p5js.org/cacheflowe/sketches/ZbOawrLPw)

## üõ†Ô∏è Iteration

  * `for()` loops
  * Nested `for()` loops
    * Grids!

## üìù Homework:

* Read:
  * "[Why Love Generative Art?](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/why-love-generative-art)" - A history of the medium
* Watch:
  * [Robert Hodgin @ Eyeo 2014](https://vimeo.com/103537259) - watch at least the first 13 minutes
    * If you love this, watch [Robert Hodgin @ Eyeo 2012](https://vimeo.com/45526286)
* Browse & collect inspiration. Save your favorite links for next class
  * [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/)
  * [CodePen](https://codepen.io/search/pens?q=p5js)
  * [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/)
* Program a [poster](https://www.instagram.com/tim_rodenbroeker/)
  * Use shapes, color, type, images
  * If you're not great with colors, use a [palette generator](https://coolors.co/palettes)
  * Find [inspiration](https://www.google.com/search?q=bauhaus+poster+design) and borrow ideas if you're not a natural designer. If you really want to keep it simple, replicate an existing design, but credit the original designer in the comments.
  * If you are a designer, try to make something more contemporary, or in your own style
  * For stretch goals:
    * Use grids
    * Swap colors with a key press or mouse position
    * Make multiple posters
    * Randomize elements

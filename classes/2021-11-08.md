# Class 11 | November 8

## üõ†Ô∏è Project in progress

* Billy Griffin
* Snow particles
* New Generator

## Upcoming classes

* What do we want to discuss?

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging

* [p5js Debugging article](https://p5js.org/learn/debugging.html)
* What to do when something doesn't work
  * Does your IDE point out any syntax problems?
  * Is there an error message in the console?
    * Is there a "[stack trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace)"?
  * Check your syntax
  * Can you make a more basic version of the code do something?
  * Double-check the documentation
  * Do some Googling - has someone else had this problem?
* General debugging
  * Syntax errors
  * Reference errors (is your code pointing to the right thing?)
  * `console.log()` / `println()`
  * Debuggers - [live demo](http://localhost/haxademic.js/demo/#three-scene)
* Graphical debugging
  * It's hard...
  * If something isn't displaying, can you make a simpler version?
  * Add a "debug view"

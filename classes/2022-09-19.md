# Class 4

## üìã Review code

* Present your clocks
* How do we feel about time?

## üõ†Ô∏è How to build anything

* [Break the problem down](https://twitter.com/monicaaquirk/status/1298447577671561216)
  * Google the components of the problem
* Write ugly code, then clean it up once it works
  * Don't over-engineer it until it's working
* Ask someone for help!
* What happens when you hit a wall?
  * Sleep on it
  * Go for a walk
  * Try a different approach or reduce your ambition this time around. You'll figure it out with persistence!
* Build your toolkit as you find solutions
  * [Haxademic](https://github.com/cacheflowe/haxademic/) is one of mine

## üõ†Ô∏è Strings

* The [String object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)
  * Practical uses
    * `indexOf()`
    * `charAt()`
    * `substring()`
    * `trim()`
    * `match()`
    * `replace()`
    * Live demo in console
  * Fun uses
    * New sketch for text-based visual effects
* Text manipulation [exercises](https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/text-and-type/)

## üõ†Ô∏è Images

* `image()`
* `get()`
  * [Re-drawing images](https://editor.p5js.org/cacheflowe/sketches/RNbj-2IV0)
    * [p5 video example](https://p5js.org/examples/dom-video-pixels.html)
* `texture()` w/`vertex()`
  * [UV coordinates](https://editor.p5js.org/cacheflowe/sketches/DhW4CrQ18)!
  * Gradients via vertices
* More exercises

## üõ†Ô∏è Looping Animations

* [Example loops](https://cacheflowe.com/art/digital) from Justin
* Time, according to the computer:
  * Frames (`frameCount`) or milliseconds `millis()`
  * `deltaTime`
* `lerp()` Live demo
* Modulo (`%`)
  * Use as an array index of colors!
* `sin()`

## üìù Homework

* Read:
  * [Line](https://wblut.com/line/) by @wblut
    * Discusses OOP techniques around the concept of a `line()`
  * [Sketching with Math and Quasi Physics](https://kynd.github.io/p5sketches/)
* Watch:
  * [Exploring Emergence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOqOyb51prU) by Andy Lomas
* Build a looping animation
  * Make a seamless loop of some sort, starting with [this example](https://editor.p5js.org/cacheflowe/sketches/JWQn2Wn4E)
  * Some ideas
    * Scale something up and countdown
    * Cycle colors
    * Oscillate other properties of your graphics
    * Remap a looping number to do something less obviously-looping
    * Try to recreate a Bees & Bombs-style loop
  * Inspiration loops
    * [Bees & Bombs](https://beesandbombs.tumblr.com/page/22)

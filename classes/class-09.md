## üõ†Ô∏è Open Source

Open source software (OSS) = Freely-available source code!

* Be aware of the different kinds of OSS [licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses)
  * These determine how you can (or can't) legally use the code in your projects. Make sure you're allowed to use the code for your commercial (or non-commercial) purposes.
* [How does open source happen?](http://opensource.guide/)
  * [Aligning an Open Source Ethos](https://opensourceethos.net/)
  * OS development [funding models](https://mkaz.blog/misc/open-souce-funding-models/)
  * Internal tools that become their own library, like [React](https://react.dev/) by Meta (Facebook)
  * Personal projects or tooling that the author wants to share
    * Mine is [Haxademic](https://github.com/cacheflowe/haxademic)
  * [What open source project should I contribute to?](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/what-open-source-project-should-i-contribute-to)
* The dark sides of open source
  * [The struggles of an open source maintainer](http://antirez.com/news/129) - being a OSS maintainer can be *difficult*
  * [Awful OSS Incidents](https://github.com/PayDevs/awful-oss-incidents) - open source can create security risks

Open source libraries & frameworks that you'll find

* Many popular OSS projects are either a library or a framework
* [What is the difference between a framework and a library?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_MO9vIRBcA)
* p5js is a larger **framework**, but has **[libraries](https://p5js.org/libraries/)** that can add extra functionality

Package (library) managers

* Why use a package (library) manager?
  * Quick & easy to add functionality to your project
  * Dependency management - any library you use may have its own dependencies, and the package manager will download (and solve version conflicts) for you
  * It's nice to have one source for the latest tools
* Downsides of package managers
  * [Writing Javascript without a build system](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/16/writing-javascript-without-a-build-system/)
  * [Security risks](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/09/npm-package-with-3-million-weekly-downloads-had-a-severe-vulnerability/)
  * Large download size (with lots of extra library dependencies you might not use) [Nodejs meme](../images/node-modules-meme.png)
  * Versioning/dependencies can break or become outdated over time [dependency meme](../images/get-old-repo-to-run.png)
* Different languages have different package managers
  * `p5js`: [Doesn't have one](https://p5js.org/libraries/)! You include remote javascript files or upload them
  * `Processing` & `Arduino`: library manager inside IDE
  * `Javascript`: npm
  * `Java`: Maven or Gradle
  * `Ruby`: Bundler
  * `Python`: pip or conda
  * `OS X`: Homebrew
  * `Windows`: Chocolatey

**Build something with audio**

* Ideas:
  * Write a program that plays a sound file along with a graphical element
  * Build an interactive or self-playing instrument
  * Visualize microphone or audio file analysis
  * Synthesize some sounds with oscillators
  * Build a drum pad/machine like [Bongo.cat](https://bongo.cat/)
  * Use MIDI
* Resources: Free audio files
  * [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/)
  * [sampleswap.org](https://sampleswap.org/)
